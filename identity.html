This flow is suitable for integrating adesktop application with Salesforce, as it does not require the user to enter their credentials in the application, but rather redirects them to the Salesforce login page to authenticate and authorize theapplication2. This way, theintegration between the desktop application and Salesforce is seamless and secure. The other options are not optimal for this requirement because:\nJWT Bearer Token Flow is an OAuth authorization flow that allows a client application to obtain an access token by sending a signed JSON Web Token (JWT) to Salesforce3. This flow does not involve user interaction, and requires the client application to have a certificate and a private key to sign the JWT. This flow is more suitable for server-to-server integration, not for desktop application integration.\n\nUser Agent Flow is an OAuth authorization flow that allows a user-agent-based application (such as a browser or a mobile app) to obtain an access token by redirecting the user to Salesforce and receiving the token in the URL fragment4. This flow is not suitable for desktop application integration, as it requires the application to parse the URLfragment and store the token securely.\n\nUsername and Password Flow is an OAuth authorization flow that allows a client application to obtain an access token by sending the user's username and password to Salesforce5.

Option B is not a good choice because creating an Apex scheduled job in one org that will synchronize the other orgs profile may not be scalable, reliable, or secure. Option C is not a good choice because implementing Delegated Authentication that will update the user profiles as necessary may not be feasible, as Delegated Authentication only verifies the user's credentials against an external service, but does not pass any other information to Salesforce.

SAML is a protocol that allows users to authenticate andauthorize with an external identity provider and access Salesforce resources.

An RSA token is a hardware device thatgenerates a one-time password (OTP) that changes every few seconds. The user needs to enter both their password and the OTP to log in to Salesforce.\nD is correct because requiring users to use a biometric reader as well as their password is another form oftwo- factor authentication. A biometric reader is a device that scans a user's fingerprint, face, iris, or other physical characteristics to verify their identity. The user needs to provide both their password and their biometric data to log in to Salesforce.\nB is incorrect because requiring users to supply their email and phone number, which gets validated, is not a form of two-factor authentication. This is a form of identity verification, which is used to confirm that the user owns the email and phone number they provided. However, this does not add an extra layer of protection beyond their password when they log in to Salesforce.\nC is incorrect because requiring users to enter a second password after the first authentication is not a form of two-factor authentication.

The SPs are the websites that hostapps and rely on the IdPs for authentication5. In this case, Salesforce Org 2, Financial System, and CPQ Systemare the SPs that receive the SAML assertions or OAuth tokens from the IdPs and grant access to the users.\nOption A is incorrect because Financial System is not an IdP, but an SP. It does not authenticate the users, but receives SAML assertions from Pingfederate. Option C is incorrect because Salesforce Org 2 is not an IdP, but an SP. It does not authenticate the users, but receives OAuth tokens from Salesforce Org 1.\nReferences: 5: Identity Providers and Service Providers - Salesforce 6: Salesforce as Service Provider and Identity Provider for SSO","id":225},{"text":"Universal Containers (UC) has implemented SAML-based SSO solution for use with their multi-org Salesforce implementation, utilizing one ofthe the orgs as the Identity Provider.

When using SAML SSO, Salesforce matches the Federation ID value with the NameID element in the SAML assertion to identify the user. To troubleshoot the issue of getting a generic SAML error message when accessing the other orgs, the architect should review the following considerations:\nThe Federation ID must be case sensitive, which means that the value in the user record must match exactly with the value in the SAML assertion. For example, if the Federation ID is “John.Doe”, then “john.doe” or “JOHN.DOE” will not work.\nThe Federation ID must be populated on the user record, which means that the user must have a value for this field in each org that they want to access via SSO. If the Federation ID is blank or missing, then Salesforce will not be able to match the user with the SAML assertion.","id":226},{"text":"Universal containers (UC) is building a mobile application that will make calls to the salesforce RESTAPI.
